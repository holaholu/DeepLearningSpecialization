    "Your assistant has collected a list of all the dinosaur names they could find, and compiled them into this [dataset](dinos.txt). To create new dinosaur names, you will build a character-level language model to generate new names. Your algorithm will learn the different name patterns, and randomly generate new names. Hopefully this algorithm will keep you and your team safe from the dinosaurs' wrath! "
