    "\n",
    "#### Process for Synthesizing an audio clip\n",
    "* To synthesize a single training example, you will:\n",
    "    - Pick a random 10 second background audio clip\n",
    "    - Randomly insert 0-4 audio clips of \"activate\" into this 10 sec. clip\n",
    "    - Randomly insert 0-2 audio clips of negative words into this 10 sec. clip\n",
    "* Because you had synthesized the word \"activate\" into the background clip, you know exactly when in the 10 second clip the \"activate\" makes its appearance. \n",
    "    * You'll see later that this makes it easier to generate the labels $y^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ as well. \n",

    "* Suppose the synthesized \"activate\" clip ends at the 5 second mark in the 10 second audio - exactly halfway into the clip. \n",
    "* Recall that $T_y = 1375$, so timestep $687 = $ `int(1375*0.5)` corresponds to the moment 5 seconds into the audio clip. \n",
    "* Set $y^{\\langle 688 \\rangle} = 1$. \n",
    "* We will allow the GRU to detect \"activate\" anywhere within a short time-internal **after** this moment, so we actually **set 50 consecutive values** of the label $y^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ to 1. \n",

Therefore, even if the activation word could appear at any point within these 10 seconds, it can be detected immediately upon being spoken. If the algorithm initially fails to detect it, further detections with each subsequent second provide additional opportunities for recognition. This approach efficiently balances performance with timely detection attempts."
