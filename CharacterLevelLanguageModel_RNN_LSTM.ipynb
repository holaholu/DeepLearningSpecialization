    "You can see that your algorithm has started to generate plausible dinosaur names towards the end of training. At first, it was generating random characters, but towards the end you could begin to see dinosaur names with cool endings. Feel free to run the algorithm even longer and play with hyperparameters to see if you can get even better results! Our implementation generated some really cool names like `maconucon`, `marloralus` and `macingsersaurus`. Your model hopefully also learned that dinosaur names tend to end in `saurus`, `don`, `aura`, `tor`, etc."

    "A similar task to character-level text generation (but more complicated) is generating Shakespearean poems. Instead of learning from a dataset of dinosaur names, you can use a collection of Shakespearean poems. Using LSTM cells, you can learn longer-term dependencies that span many characters in the text--e.g., where a character appearing somewhere a sequence can influence what should be a different character, much later in the sequence. These long-term dependencies were less important with dinosaur names, since the names were quite short. \n",
