    "## 1 - Positional Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "In sequence to sequence tasks, the relative order of your data is extremely important to its meaning. When you were training sequential neural networks such as RNNs, you fed your inputs into the network in order. Information about the order of your data was automatically fed into your model.  However, when you train a Transformer network using multi-head attention, you feed your data into the model all at once. While this dramatically reduces training time, there is no information about the order of your data. This is where positional encoding is useful - you can specifically encode the positions of your inputs and pass them into the network using these sine and cosine formulas:\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$\n",
    "PE_{(pos, 2i)}= sin\\left(\\frac{pos}{{10000}^{\\frac{2i}{d}}}\\right)\n",
    "\\tag{1}$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$$\n",
    "PE_{(pos, 2i+1)}= cos\\left(\\frac{pos}{{10000}^{\\frac{2i}{d}}}\\right)\n",
    "\\tag{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $d$ is the dimension of the word embedding and positional encoding\n",
    "* $pos$ is the position of the word.\n",
    "* $k$ refers to each of the different dimensions in the positional encodings, with $i$ equal to $k$ $//$ $2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop some intuition about positional encodings, you can think of them broadly as a feature that contains the information about the relative positions of words. The sum of the positional encoding and word embedding is ultimately what is fed into the model. If you just hard code the positions in, say by adding a matrix of 1's or whole numbers to the word embedding, the semantic meaning is distorted. Conversely, the values of the sine and cosine equations are small enough (between -1 and 1) that when you add the positional encoding to a word embedding, the word embedding is not significantly distorted, and is instead enriched with positional information. Using a combination of these two equations helps your Transformer network attend to the relative positions of your input data."

    "Your input sentence first passes through a *multi-head attention layer*, where the encoder looks at other words in the input sentence as it encodes a specific word. The outputs of the multi-head attention layer are then fed to a *feed forward neural network*. The exact same feed forward network is independently applied to each position.\n",
    "   \n",
    "* For the `MultiHeadAttention` layer, you will use the [Keras implementation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/MultiHeadAttention). If you're curious about how to split the query matrix Q, key matrix K, and value matrix V into different heads, you can look through the implementation. \n",

    "**Note:** In Python, the `__call__` method allows you to call an object like a function. TensorFlow leverages this by providing a `call` function within Keras layers.  This means you can use a layer like `a_Layer(arg)` and TensorFlow will internally execute `a_Layer.call(arg)` to process your data.  This design makes it intuitive to apply layers within your TensorFlow models. "
